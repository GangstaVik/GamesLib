# My first attempt at a personal, custom GamesLib

## Dedicated to
- Hardcore gamers who needs some way of keeping track of the games they've played which is not a piece of paper
- Avg gamers who like to stay organized and love to review what they've played to know what to play next
- Entry-level gamers who need suggestion and know not where to look for it

## What's coming next
- Steam API integration (for games' info)
- Steam DB - like UI for better UX (for a better view of your lib)
- Page Themes ( to allow for even more customization over your own library of games )
- Game reviews ( so you can keep track of what a game made you feel what or not )
- Libs sharing ( to let other people know your taste and share your gaming knowledge )
- Libs ranking ( be the finest gamer in the world! )
  
- .NET rework of the website using blazor (I'm still a beginner when it comes to blazor but I am learning)
